Explanation: 'Snorted' is a verb that can be used both literally and metaphorically. However, in the sentence 'The critic snorted contemptuously', it is used metaphorically. 'Snorted' is a verb that means to expel air from the nose with a sudden burst of air, but in this context, it is used to convey contempt or disdain. The critic is not literally snorting air, but rather expressing their contempt through a figurative expression.
